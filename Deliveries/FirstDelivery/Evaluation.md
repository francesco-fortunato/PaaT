# Evaluation

## Performance Evaluation during Development:

- Evaluation of Network Technologies:
The network technology used in the IoT pet tracking system is LoRa, which operates on the unlicensed frequency spectrum. The performance of LoRa will be evaluated based on its range, throughput, and reliability. For example, a network analyzer tool, like Wireshark, will be used to capture and analyze the network traffic, and performance metrics will be recorded, such as packet delivery ratio, latency, and jitter.

- Evaluation of Algorithms Used:
The algorithms used in the IoT pet tracking system will be evaluated based on their accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness. The accuracy of the algorithms will be measured by comparing the GPS data received by the system with the actual location of the pet. The efficiency of the algorithms will be evaluated by measuring the time taken to process the data and transmit it to the cloud. The effectiveness of the algorithms will be evaluated by measuring the system's ability to track the pet accurately, even in areas with poor network coverage.

- Evaluation of Embedded Devices:
The ESP32 LoRa devices used in the IoT pet tracking system will be evaluated based on their power consumption and energy efficiency. A power analyzer tool, such as a multimeter, will be used to measure the power consumed by the devices during operation. The data obtained will be used to calculate the energy efficiency of the devices.

- Evaluation of End-user Response Time:
The response time of the IoT pet tracking system will be evaluated also from an end-user point of view. This will involve measuring the time taken for the system to detect the location of the pet, process the data, and send it to the cloud. The response time will be measured through the response time, and the data obtained will be used to calculate the average response time.

## When the First Complete Version of the System is Ready for Use, :

- Evaluation of Network Technologies:
The performance of the LoRa network will be evaluated based on its reliability, scalability, and security. The network will be tested under different conditions, such as varying distances between the devices, different network loads, and network interference. The network analyzer tool, such as Wireshark, will be used to capture and analyze the network traffic, and performance metrics will be recorded, such as packet delivery ratio, latency, and jitter.

- Evaluation of Algorithms Used:
The accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the algorithms used in the IoT pet tracking system will be evaluated under real-world conditions. The system will be tested in different environments, such as urban and rural areas, and the accuracy of the location data will be compared with the actual location of the pet. The efficiency of the algorithms will be evaluated by measuring the time taken to process the data and transmit it to the cloud. The effectiveness of the algorithms will be evaluated by measuring the system's ability to track the pet accurately, even in areas with poor network coverage.

- Evaluation of Embedded Devices:
The power consumption and energy efficiency of the ESP32 LoRa devices will be evaluated under real-world conditions. The devices will be tested in different environments, such as urban and rural areas, and the power consumed by the devices will be measured using a power analyzer tool, such as a multimeter. The data obtained will be used to calculate the energy efficiency of the devices.

- Evaluation of End-user Response Time:
This will involve testing the system in different environments and under varying network conditions to ensure that it functions reliably and efficiently. The user interface of the system will also be evaluated for ease of use and intuitiveness. Also user feedback can be solicited through surveys or interviews to gain insights into the system's usability and any areas for improvement.
